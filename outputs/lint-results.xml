        summary="Inconsistencies in array element counts"
        explanation="When an array is translated in a different locale, it should normally have the same number of elements as the original array. When adding or removing elements to an array, it is easy to forget to update all the locales, and this lint warning finds inconsistencies like these.

Note however that there may be cases where you really want to declare a different number of array items in each configuration (for example where the array represents available options, and those options differ for different layout orientations and so on), so use your own judgement to decide if this is really an error.

You can suppress this error type if it finds false errors in your project."

This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly.

Similarly,a hint attribute displays a hint to the user for what is expected in the text field.

The lint detector also looks at the `id` of the view, and if the id offers a hint of the purpose of the field (for example, the `id` contains the phrase `phone` or `email`), then lint will also ensure that the `inputType` contains the corresponding type attributes.

If you really want to keep the text field generic, you can suppress this warning by setting `inputType=&quot;text&quot;`."

For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and `layout_marginLeft`, use `paddingStart` and `layout_marginStart`. *NOTE*: If your `minSdkVersion` is less than 17, you should add *both* the older left/right attributes *as well as* the new start/right attributes.

There is a separate lint check which catches that type of error.
